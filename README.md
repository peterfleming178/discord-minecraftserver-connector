# discord-minecraftserver-connector
An discord bot to connect your minecraft server with a discord bot.

# Note
This bot is used to connect a minecraft server which is running in a linux screen directly to discord chat. While a discord SRV can be used for some reason the minecraft server from snap store does not come with features of plugins, so this is a custom implementation of what you would have got.
This bot is in primitive stage and will be updated soon so check this page for any updates.
